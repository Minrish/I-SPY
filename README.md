        II.  Segmented ContentView to ContentView (Navigation Control), CameraModeView (Camera-Mode specific view), 
             PictureModeView (Picture-Mode specific view).
        III. Added animation for buttons for better user experiences in both modes. 
        IV.  Focuses more on object identification results, accents the output.
